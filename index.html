   <h1 class="section">When is a surveyor needed?</h1>
  
   <p>A survey is needed when land is bought/sold, before land is divided, if a line/corner location is unknown or in dispute, if a money-lending agency requires a survey, before constructing a building/fence, before conveying a lot that has not been surveyed, before conveying a lot from a larger tract and the lot has not been surveyed, before cutting timber near a property line, when you believe someone is encroaching on your land, and to establish easement and right-of-way.<p>
  
   <h1 class="section">What can a surveyor do for me?</h1>
                
   <p>A surveyor can examine your deed and those of adjoiners and look for evidence on the ground to see if there are problems, advise if you actually need a survey, mark and paint lines, survey subdivisions, establish new corners and markers, make contour maps and show the elevations, and locate: oil/gas wells, building, fences, right-of-way, encroachments, and other possible evidence.<p>

   <h1 class="section">What does the surveyor need from me</h1>
                      
   <p>A surveyor needs the purpose of the survey, your deed/copy of it or the book and page where it is recorded in the County Register's Office, any plats you have and information about locations of corners and lines, a brief history of ownership, the name and address of adjoiners and any information about disagreements over location or corners and lines.<p>
                            
   <h1 class="section">What can I do to protect my propery lines and markers?</h1>
                           
   <p>You can inspect the lines occasionally, retighten pipes and stone markers, (do not relocate them), repaint: marked trees, pipes or stone markers every ten years, and record the plat and description even if the land is not conveyed.<p>

   <h1 class="section">How much will my survey cost?</h1>
                              
   <p>There are many factors involved including the purpose of the survey and the equipment needed, deed research required, number of unknown corners, existence of fences, vagueness of descriptions, number of acres, terrain and vegetation, accessibilty, liability, if the surveyor has made other surveys in the area and if there are disputes over any lines. You should recieve a schedule of rates of travel and mileage expenses, cost of markers, paint, etc. from the surveyor. The surveyor may be able to give you an estamate of total cost, or a "high" or "low" figure, but he may not be bound by those figures. Keep in mind, low cost sureys can be poor surveys. A good survey that meets your need and legal requirements may cost more but will be less expensive in the long run.
                              
   <h1 class="section">Caution for landowners</h1>
                              
   <p>Do not mistake preliminary traverse lines for true lines. Do not move or relocate markers. Do not seek the cheapest surveyor; select one who will do aa satisfactory job for you. Do contact the surveyor well before the survey is needed.<p>
